### CoveoGoogleMap
Will show a googlemap with all the results plotted on it. It assume's there are two fields containing the lat/lon.
After zooming in/out/panning the map will redraw and the boundaries will be used to filter the search results.
Clicking on a point will act as a filter (using a query function) to only show items within 1000 m of the selected point.
