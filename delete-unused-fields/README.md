## Delete Unused Fields

This is a [Coveo Cloud V2](https://platform.cloud.coveo.com) script to delete all the fields that are not associated to a source in your organization.

The syntax is `node deleteUnusedFields.js your-api-key your-org-id`, where you replace `your-api-key` with a valid API key, and `your-org-id` with the id of the org you want to check.

There are no external dependencies required for this script to run, except for [node](https://nodejs.org).
